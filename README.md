# Approximate solutions of integro-differential equations by piecewise 3rd Bezier functions and conjugate gradient method

This is an algorithm for finding the numerical solution of the general (2nd order) integro-differential equation by the piecewise polynomial (3rd Bezier) functions.
The main improvements here are the consideration of the piecewise 3rd Bezier functions with $C^1$ continuity and the use of the conjugate gradient method to find the approximate solution of integro-differential equations.
